       As part of the contractor registration process,

       <p><strong>Option 1 – Progress Registration</strong></p>
       <p>
       If you think that Amni should investigate this contractor further and carry out Due Diligence Checks then please:
       <ol type="a">
       <li>
       Confirm that you have reviewed the uploaded information and found that the contractor appears to be a suitable contractor for your Department.

       Select the type of services you would consider this Contractor could provide to Amni. (Please only select services for which you would be the “end-user”)

       <li>
       Indicate if a site visit is required by an Amni Team to verify the capacity of ${companyName}.

       <p><strong>Option 2 – Complete Registration at this point.</strong></p>
       <p>
       If, after reviewing the information uploaded on the portal, you think that this contractor is NOT a suitable contractor for your Department, please select this option and the contractor’s registration will be complete at this point.
